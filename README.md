# Welcome to hck-scripts

Here you'll find some of the scripts I've developed for automating the 
tasks related to my pentesting and CTFs projects. 

* [pwddumpstatscrack](/pwddumpstatscrack): analyses a .csv file of users and tries to crack the passwords with Hashcat.
* [pwdbruteforce](/pwdbruteforce): brute forces a login page trying to get the correct password of a given email/username through a dictionary file.
* More coming soon!
